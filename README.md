## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/laboral-vital-signs-dashboard.git
    cd laboral-vital-signs-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Prepare Data:**
    *   Ensure you have sample CSV files in the `data/` directory:
        *   `stability_data.csv`
        *   `safety_data.csv`
        *   `engagement_data.csv`
        *   `stress_data.csv`
    *   Refer to the `load_and_prepare_data` function in `app.py` for expected columns. You may need to create these files with sample data or adjust the loading function to match your existing files.

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
The dashboard will open in your default web browser.
⚙️ Configuration
Global constants and default settings can be adjusted in config.py.
🖼️ Visualization Customization
Custom Plotly plotting functions can be developed or extended in visualizations.py to keep app.py cleaner.
♿ Accessibility & Inclusivity Considerations
Language: The application supports English and Spanish. Translations are managed in the TRANSLATIONS dictionary within app.py.
Colors: Dark theme is implemented with consideration for color contrast. Colorblind-safe palettes are used for categorical data in charts.
Icons: Emojis are selected for broad recognition and neutrality.
Responsiveness: Streamlit provides a degree of responsiveness for different screen sizes.
